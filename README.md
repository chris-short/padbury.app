An homage to Padbury Clock: A basic digital clock screensaver from Australian American designer Robert Padbury that displays the current time in an elegant and legible font, in either a 12 or a 24 hour format.

Padbury Clock allowed users to, "Transform your Mac into an elegant minimalist clock with this Screen Saver." But, a few years ago, it disappeared off the web. I am bringing it back from the dead (with no support or guarantees).

Padbury Clock Screensaver, made by Robert Padbury, debuted on Product Hunt on 2015-03-26. It quickly rose to #3 Product of the Day. Rightfully so; Padbury Clock has been one of my favorite screensavers of all time since that day.
